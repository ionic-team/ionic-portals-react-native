## FAQ

### What is the pricing for Portals use?

[Contact our sales team](https://ionic.io/portals#sales) for more information about pricing.

### Is Portals Open Source?

See our [license](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-portals/blob/main/LICENSE.md).

### How is Portals Related to Capacitor and Ionic?

Ionic Portals is a solution that lets you add web-based experiences to your native mobile apps. Portals uses [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com) as a bridge between the native code and the web code to allow for cross-communication between the two layers. Because Portals uses Capacitor under the hood, you are able to use any existing [Capacitor Plugins](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/plugins) while continuing to use your existing native workflow.

[Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/) is the open-source mobile app development framework that makes it easy to build top quality native and progressive web apps with web technologies. Your web experiences can be developed with Ionic, but it is not necessary to use Portals.
